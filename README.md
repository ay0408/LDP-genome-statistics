# LDP-genome-statistics

This contains Python codes used in our experiments on local differentially private (LDP) methods to release genome statistics.
Our methods utilize the Randomized Response technique to satisfy LDP.

The procedure to generate simulation data on genome statistics can be found in the "Simulation Data" file.

"Accuracy" files contain the experimental results on differences between the original and private statistics.

## Note

For details of our mechanisms, please see our paper entitled "Privacy-Preserving Genomic Statistical Analysis under Local Differential Privacy".
